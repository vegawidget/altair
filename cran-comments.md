## Author notes

This package offers a pass-through to a Python library, Altair. Its 
functionality is to install Altair, then to establish the connection between R
and Python.

As such, virtually all the examples and tests cannot be run on CRAN servers, 
hence the `\dontrun{}` and the like on examples, and skipping of tests. 

This functionality is tested on GitHub Actions, where the Python libraries are available.
