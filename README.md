# altair

The goal of altair is to help you build
[**Vega-Lite**](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite) visualizations. Using
the [**reticulate**](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate) package, it
provides an interface to the [**Altair**](https://altair-viz.github.io)
Python package. This approach is distinct from efforts to build a native
R interface to Vega-Lite, by [Bob Rudis](https://github.com/hrbrmstr)
and coworkers: the [**vegalite**](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/vegalite)
package, which has inspired this effort.

In this documentation, the capitalized word **Altair** shall refer to
the Python package; the lower-case word **altair** shall refer to this R
package.

## Installation

A development version is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vegawidget/altair") 
```

Because you are using a Python package, you may have some additional
installation steps. These steps are described in greater detail in the
[Installation](https://vegawidget.github.io/altair/articles/installation.html)
article.

1.  Python must be installed on your system. We have has success using
    [Conda](https://conda.io/docs);
    [Miniconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html#anaconda-or-miniconda)
    works well and installs more-quickly than Anaconda.
    
    If you work in a corporate or institutional environment, you may
    have to specify the location of your SSL certificate, or deal with a
    proxy. The installation article has a
    [section](https://vegawidget.github.io/altair/articles/installation.html#proxies)
    on this.

2.  Create a Conda environment called `"r-reticulate"`. The reticulate
    folks
    [recommend](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/python_packages.html)
    standardizing on a common name for all packages that use reticulate.
    For more information, there is a
    [section](https://vegawidget.github.io/altair/articles/installation.html#python-env)
    in the installation article.

3.  Install Altair into your `"r-reticulate"` environment using
    `altair::install_altair()`.

You may wish to add a line like this to the `.First()` function in your
`.Rprofile`:

``` r
reticulate::use_condaenv("r-reticulate")
```

The `use_condaenv()` function is called to provide a [hint to
reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/versions.html#order-of-discovery)
on which Python environment to use.

### Optional installations

If you have **[nodejs](https://nodejs.org)** installed on your computer,
you can use [vegawidget’s image-generating
functions](https://vegawidget.github.io/vegawidget/reference/image.html)
to convert Altair charts into SVG strings or write SVG files. With the
**[rsvg](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rsvg)** and
**[png](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=png)** packages installed,
you can get a bitmap array, or write PNG files.

When knitting to a non-HTML format, e.g. `github_document`, this package
provides a `knit_print()` function that will intercept the normal
renderer, using instead its own renderer, allowing you to specify
`"png"` , `"svg"` or `"pdf"`. Like the image functions, this requires
that [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) be installed on your system, as well
as [rsvg](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rsvg) and
[png](https://cran.r-project.org/package=png). MacOS users will require
an X11 system, such as [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org), to be
installed.

## Example

``` r
library("altair")

vega_data <- import_vega_data()

chart <- 
  alt$Chart(vega_data$cars())$
  mark_point()$
  encode(
    x = "Horsepower:Q",
    y = "Miles_per_Gallon:Q",
    color = "Origin:N"
  )

chart
```

Some things to keep in mind:

  - Where you see a `.` in the Python examples, use a `$` instead.

  - In your data, columns that contain dots can be wrapped in square
    brackets in Altair specifications, e.g. `[Sepal.Width]`, to keep
    Altair from throwing an error. Alternatively, you can use a
    double-backslash, e.g. `Sepal\\.Width`.

These and other “gotchas” are compiled, along with workarounds, in an
article: [Field Guide to Python
Issues](https://vegawidget.github.io/altair/articles/field-guide-python.html).

Gallery:

  - An adaptation to R of the [Altair Example

## Acknowledgements

This package rests on these foundations:

  - [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io): Python interface to
    Vega-Lite

  - [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate): R framework to
    work with Python

  - [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite): a grammar of
    interactive graphics

  - [htmlwidgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/): R framework to work
    with JavaScript visualizations

As well, a particular debt is owed to the folks behind the
[vegalite](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/vegalite) package, as it provided
a lot of the inspiration for these efforts.

This project is a collaborative effort. In addition to the principal
authors:

  - [Alicia Schep](https://github.com/AliciaSchep) has contributed the
    concatenation functions, as well as sorted out many of the Python,
    JavaScript, and package-API issues.

  - [Heike Hofmann](https://github.com/heike) has been an invaluable
    advisor, providing incisive feedback, and insight into the
    fundamentals of interactive graphics.
