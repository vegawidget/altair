The purpose of this package is to be a faithful interface to the [Python Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io) API. Currently, this R package provides:

1. Access, via [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/), to Altair objects and methods to create and compose Vega-Lite charts.
1. The means to display charts using the `vegawiget()` and friends, via [htmlwidgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org).

In the short term, the thougth is to focus on a small number of items:

1. Tightening up the existing capabilities. 
1. Will likely split the `vegawidget()` function, with its friends, into its own package. This would not introduce any API changes to this package.
1. Tooltips.

The longer term will require more thought and consultation. As a start, it might be interesting to construct some R functions along the lines of:

```r
alt_chart <- function(data, ...) {
  alt$Chart(r_to_py(data), ...)
}
```

Such an this approach would support piping, but at the cost of risking namespace collisions, as detailed in this [discussion](https://github.com/g2inR/g2r/issues/1) on ideas for porting the [g2 visualization library](https://antv.alipay.com/zh-cn/g2/3.x/index.html). Another thing to consider is how much effort it would take to provide full coverage of the Python API. 

This effort is already underway with Alicia Schep's new package [autopyr](https://github.com/AliciaSchep/autopyr).

It is worth noting what this package is not. In this package, I do not want to introduce any new ideas or opinions - rather I think this package should remain a faithful translation of the Altair API. The authors of Altair should see this package and recognize only their opinions and intentions.

That being said, I think there is an opportunity to build another package (perhaps built on this one) that introduces opinions and tries to be a bit more ggplot2-like. Perhaps this package could include a ggplot2-translator function along the lines of `plotly::ggplotly()`.
