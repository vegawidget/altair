There are four foundations upon which this package rests: 

- the [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) Python package, to build chart specifications
- the [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html) R package, to provide inter-operability with Python
- the [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) JavaScript framework, to render chart specifications in an HTML file
- the [vegawidget](https://vegawidget.github.io) R package, which relies on [htmlwidgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/) to provide inter-operability with HTML and JavaScript

This article deals with the second two items; the [Field Guide to Python Issues](field-guide-python.html) deals with the first two.

## Vegawidget

All the rendering is handled by **vegawidget**; so you are referred to its article on [rendering](https://vegawidget.github.io/vegawidget/articles/articles/render-vegawidget.html).

The two main issues on rendering are:

- sizing
- arguments passed to [vega-embed](https://github.com/vega/vega-embed) (more specialized)

These are discussed in these sections of the vegawidget rendering-article:

- [Using vegawidget arguments](https://vegawidget.github.io/vegawidget/articles/articles/render-vegawidget.html#using-vegawidget-arguments), calling the `vegawidget()` function
- [Setting R options](https://vegawidget.github.io/vegawidget/articles/articles/render-vegawidget.html#setting-r-options), can be set a number of ways
- [Knitting strategies](https://vegawidget.github.io/vegawidget/articles/articles/render-vegawidget.html#knitting-strategies), including how to render Vega(-Lite) charts when knitting to a non-HTML format such as PDF.
